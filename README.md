# TheFloorIsLava-MW3
The Floor Is Lava in MW3! Or, well maybe it's not.

Ok so maybe the floor isn't ACTUALLY lava, but it definitely hurts. Luckily that adrenaline rush you got from nearly having your face
melted off in (not so real) molten lava has given you the ability to jump sky high! And you are now so strong, you can punch things that are so remote you can barely see them!

Fight for your life against other enemies in a melee extravaganza while flailing through the air, all while avoiding obstacles in your path.
