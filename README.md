# THERMAL - Project Jump

Project Jump was accidentally made on the **26th of January 2018** when the two current owners of Thermal Servers decided to mess around with a few gsc variables in MW3. To be more specific:

 - **g_gravity**
 - **jump_height**
 - **player_meleeRange**
 
These few changes set about a fun little game that we played for hours, before realising how much potential it had.

# Installation

At the time of writing this ReadMe (07/02/18), this Repo and the project are private while still under development. However, if this is ever opened to testers, the following is an extremely basic tutorial on how to get the gamemode installed.
The Following Tutorial should acceptable for both installation on a dedicated server, and a client:

 1. Download the ProjectJump Master Repo (development is available but not recommended as it may not be stable).
 2. Copy the scripts folder into your MW3 directory on either your server/client. If done correctly your file structure should look something similar to the following: **MW3Location/scripts/mp/*\*files related to Project Jump\****
 3. Load up your game / server and type into the console (for client press the **`** key to open the console): **loadscript thermalJump.lua** 
 4. The gamemode should load and display some information in both console and chat, and if all goes well, the gamemode should now be running.... congrats!

## Thermal Servers

Thermal Servers was created with the intention to draw attention to the [**Plutonium IW5 Project**](plutonium.pw). We believe the project deserved some recognition for what it has been able to create and wish to help it expand in the future.
You can find our servers in their server browser. They will be listed with the **[THERMAL]** tag, e.g **[THERMAL] Project Jump**.
For a full in-depth list of our Servers, as well as links to our other projects and donations page (in case you are feeling generous and want to help us keep creating our mods) visit us over at mw3.liamholmes.co.uk
